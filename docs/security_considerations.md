# **Nimbus Security Considerations**

## Overview

The **Nimbus Edge Server** is designed with security as a core principle, utilizing the **DESS (Decentralized Edge Secondary Server)** framework to ensure a **Zero Trust** environment for Industrial IoT applications. This document outlines the key security features, best practices, and configuration parameters to maintain a robust, secure deployment.

## Key Security Features

### **End-to-End Encryption**
- All communications between edge devices and the Nimbus server are fully encrypted using **atProtocol**, ensuring that data remains private and secure while traversing the network. DESS handles encryption at both the transport and storage levels.

### **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
- The **Security Gateway** continuously monitors incoming and outgoing traffic, utilizing an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to detect suspicious activities such as DDoS attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and abnormal network behaviors. Upon detection, the IDS triggers alerts and can initiate automated responses.

### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **RBAC** governs user and device permissions, ensuring that only authorized entities can interact with the server and its components. Roles such as **Admin**, **User**, and **Guest** define access levels, with strict enforcement of permissions through the **Access Control Manager**.

### **Traffic Inspection and Anomaly Detection**
- The **Security Gateway** not only encrypts traffic but also inspects it for anomalies in real-time. This feature is vital for preventing malicious data from entering or leaving the system.

## Best Practices

To ensure the highest level of security, it is essential to follow these best practices:

### 1. **Secure Configuration**
   - Always use strong, unique secrets for the `SECRET_KEY`, `CRAM_SECRET`, and other sensitive environment variables.
   - Regularly update passwords and rotate secrets at predefined intervals.
   - Monitor the email address configured for **SSL/TLS certificate management** to ensure timely updates and renewals.

### 2. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep the **DESS components**, **Nimbus server**, and all related libraries up to date to incorporate the latest security patches and feature enhancements.
   - Subscribe to relevant security bulletins and advisories for early notification of vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring**
   - Enable verbose logging through the **Logger** component to capture all security-related events, such as unauthorized access attempts or configuration changes.
   - Utilize monitoring tools to actively track IDS alerts, and configure automatic alerts for real-time notifications on suspicious activities.

### 4. **Network Security**
   - Restrict network access to essential ports only. Use **firewalls** to block unnecessary traffic and enforce strict access controls.
   - Place Nimbus behind a **VPN** or other network segmentation techniques to isolate it from external threats.
   - Ensure that all communications use **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**, and keep SSL certificates updated.

### 5. **Zero Trust Security Model**
   - Apply **Zero Trust principles**, meaning every device, user, and connection should be continuously verified and authenticated before granting access.
   - Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** where applicable to secure critical operations.
   - Restrict privileges to the least necessary for each role and entity.

## Security Configuration Parameters

These parameters control the security features within the **Nimbus Edge Server**. Adjust them according to your security requirements:

| **Parameter**       | **Description**                                                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `AuthRequired`      | Enables mandatory authentication for all incoming connections.    |
| `SecurityLevel`     | Sets the level of enforced security checks. Higher values enforce more stringent controls (e.g., IDS/IPS). |
| `EncryptionConfig`  | Specifies the encryption settings, typically aligned with **TLS** and **atProtocol** configurations. |
| `CRAM_SECRET`       | The secret used for device authentication, should be unique per instance. |
| `SSLCertPath`       | The file path to the SSL certificate used for TLS communication.  |
| `SSLKeyPath`        | The file path to the SSL private key used for establishing secure communications. |
| `LogLevel`          | Controls the verbosity of security logs. Set to `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR` based on requirements. |

## Best Practice for Logging and Alerting

1. **Log Rotation**:
   - Ensure logs are rotated periodically to avoid storage overflow. The **Logger** component handles log rotation, which can be configured in the `config.yaml` file.
   
2. **Anomaly Detection Alerts**:
   - Configure automatic alerts for detected anomalies, such as repeated failed login attempts or unusual data patterns. The **Analytics Engine** and **Security Gateway** collaborate to trigger real-time alerts.

## Zero Trust Security Model and Collaboration with DESS

The **Zero Trust** model ensures that every interaction, from device connections to data exchanges, is validated and authenticated. **DESS** plays a critical role in this by managing **atSign-based authentication** and **data encryption**, enforcing strict verification before granting access.

- **DESS Authentication**:
  - Every device must authenticate using its unique **atSign** via **CRAM authentication**. Nimbus’s **Security Gateway** works in tandem with DESS to enforce this.
  
- **Encrypted Communication**:
  - All communication within Nimbus and DESS is encrypted using **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)**, ensuring that no data is transmitted in plain text.

## Conclusion

To secure your **Nimbus Edge Server**, follow these best practices and configuration guidelines, leveraging the power of **DESS** for decentralized, end-to-end security. Regularly review logs, apply security patches, and monitor traffic to maintain a resilient defense against potential threats.
