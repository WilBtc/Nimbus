# Nimbus Security Considerations

## Overview

Nimbus Edge Server leverages the DESS framework to provide a secure, Zero Trust environment for Industrial IoT applications. This document outlines key security features and best practices to ensure the highest level of security.

## Security Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All communications between devices and the server are encrypted using the atProtocol, ensuring data privacy.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Continuously monitors traffic for malicious activities, such as DDoS attempts and unauthorized access.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Manages device and user permissions, ensuring only authorized entities can interact with the system.

## Best Practices

1. **Secure Configuration**:
   - Always use strong, unique secrets for the `SECRET` environment variable.
   - Ensure that the email used for SSL management is actively monitored.

2. **Regular Updates**:
   - Regularly update DESS components and the Nimbus server to incorporate security patches and feature improvements.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Enable comprehensive logging to capture all security-related events.
   - Use automated monitoring tools to alert on unusual activities detected by the IDS.

4. **Network Security**:
   - Run Nimbus in a secure network environment with restricted access to essential ports.
   - Use firewalls to control incoming and outgoing traffic.

5. **Zero Trust Principles**:
   - Follow Zero Trust security principles by continuously verifying device and user identities.
   - Limit permissions to the minimum necessary for operations.

## Security Configuration Parameters

| Parameter            | Description                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `AuthRequired`       | Enables authentication for all incoming connections. |
| `SecurityLevel`      | Sets the level of security checks enforced. Higher values enable more stringent controls. |
| `EncryptionConfig`   | Specifies encryption settings for data protection. |
