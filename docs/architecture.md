# Nimbus Edge Server Architecture

## Overview

Nimbus Edge Server is designed to provide secure, real-time processing for Industrial IoT applications. Built on top of the atProtocol and leveraging DESS (Decentralized Edge Secondary Server) components, Nimbus integrates advanced security, analytics, and routing tailored to industrial environments.

## High-Level Architecture

- **Core Components**: 
  - **atProtocol**: Provides secure communication between edge devices and cloud services.
  - **DESS Server**: Acts as the core server, handling secure data storage, device authentication, and communication.
  - **Security Gateway**: Manages traffic inspection, encryption, and intrusion detection.
  - **Routing Manager**: Directs data flows based on device priority and industrial logic.
  - **Analytics Engine**: Processes data in real-time, detecting anomalies and supporting decision-making.

## DESS Integration

Nimbus leverages DESS for its robust, decentralized communication and security framework. Key DESS components include:

- **AtServer**: The core server that manages secure data exchange between atSigns.
- **Encryption Engine**: Handles all cryptographic operations, ensuring data privacy and integrity.
- **IDS/IPS**: Intrusion detection systems monitor for abnormal traffic patterns, providing a critical layer of defense.

## Data Flow

1. **Device Connection**: Devices connect to the Nimbus server using their atSign, authenticating via secure protocols.
2. **Data Processing**: Incoming data is filtered, processed, and analyzed by the Analytics Engine.
3. **Routing**: Based on priority, data is routed to the appropriate channels or stored securely.
4. **Security Checks**: Traffic is continuously monitored for threats by the Security Gateway.
5. **Decision Making**: Analytics results inform decision-making logic, triggering actions as needed (e.g., adjusting device operations).

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Nimbus, ensure the following components are installed:

- **Go**: Version 1.18 or higher.
- **Docker**: For running DESS components in a containerized environment.
- **DESS (Decentralized Edge Secondary Server)**: Clone and set up from the [DESS GitHub repository](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/dess).

## Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Nimbus Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nimbus_server.git
   cd nimbus_server/server
