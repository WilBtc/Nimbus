# Nimbus Client

Nimbus Client is a secure communication and industrial protocol integration software built on the atProtocol. It is designed for Industrial IoT environments, facilitating communication with Modbus, OPC-UA, and MQTT devices, and making autonomous decisions based on real-time data processing.

## Features
- **Secure Communication**: Utilizes atProtocol for end-to-end encrypted device communication, ensuring data integrity and privacy.
- **Industrial Protocol Support**: Supports Modbus, OPC-UA, and MQTT for seamless integration with industrial equipment, enabling flexible data acquisition and control.
- **Data Processing and Decision-Making**: Built-in modules for filtering data, aggregation, statistical analysis, and automated decision logic based on critical thresholds and predictive analytics.
- **Adaptable and Scalable**: Modular design allows easy extension of protocols and decision algorithms, making Nimbus Client scalable for various industrial scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Dart SDK**: Version >=2.18.0 <3.0.0. Install from [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
- **atSign**: You need a valid atSign to use the atProtocol. Obtain one from [atsign.com](https://atsign.com/).
- **Flutter** (optional for UI development): If you plan to build or interact with any Flutter components.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wilbtc/nimbus_client.git
   cd nimbus_client
Install Dependencies: Use the following command to install the required Dart packages:

bash
Copy code
dart pub get
Configure Environment Variables: Set up the necessary environment variables for your deployment:

bash
Copy code
export ATSIGN=@youratsign
export NAMESPACE=nimbus
export ROOT_DOMAIN=root.atsign.org
export HIVE_STORAGE_PATH=./nimbus/storage
export COMMIT_LOG_PATH=./nimbus/commitLog
Configuration
Configuring the Nimbus Client: Modify config.dart to adjust your connection settings, such as storage paths, atSign, and server domain. You can also set these configurations through environment variables as shown above.
Security Settings: Security settings, including key management and encryption protocols, are handled automatically but can be customized in security_manager.dart if advanced configurations are needed.
Usage
Run the Nimbus Client: Use the following command to start the application:

bash
Copy code
dart run src/main.dart
Interacting with Industrial Protocols:

Modbus: Use the ModbusAdaptor to read and write registers from Modbus devices.
OPC-UA: Connect to OPC-UA servers to read or write nodes, enabling real-time data exchange with industrial sensors.
MQTT: Utilize the MQTT client for lightweight messaging, supporting publish-subscribe patterns for device communication.
Data Processing and Decision-Making:

The system processes raw data using the DataProcessor to filter, aggregate, and normalize information.
The DecisionEngine evaluates the processed data against predefined thresholds and historical trends to automate responses and control actions.
Testing
Run the tests using:

bash
Copy code
dart test
Unit Tests: Ensure that individual modules work as expected.
Integration Tests: Validate the interaction between different components, especially protocol adaptors and decision engines.
Security Considerations
Nimbus Client is designed with security as a priority:

Encryption: All communications are end-to-end encrypted using atProtocol’s cryptographic standards.
Key Management: Keys are securely managed within the application, with signing and verification for message integrity.
Access Control: Advanced permissions can be configured to restrict access to specific data and functionalities, ensuring only authorized devices and users interact with the system.
Troubleshooting
Connection Issues: Ensure that all environment variables are correctly set and that the target devices are accessible over the network.
Data Errors: Verify that data types and node IDs used in Modbus and OPC-UA interactions are correct and compatible with the connected devices.
Security Errors: Check the key management and ensure that the atSign is properly registered and configured for secure communication.
